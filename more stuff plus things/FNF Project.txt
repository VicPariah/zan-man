-Database will contain the FNF Event History
-Python script, use pyodbc and mysql
-IRC Bot to interface with database
-Do stuff with database like you did with FNF in skulltag!
	-ideas:
		1.) Total # of events per gamemode
		2.) Mods played?
		3.) Look at the gamemode that has been neglected the most recently (could be multiple)
		4.) ???
