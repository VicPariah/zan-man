-Database will contain the FNF and SNS event histories, but the data needs to be fetched from all those .CFG files
-Python script collects this data, use pyodbc and mysql (but be able to save locally to .csv file if there's no database)
-IRC Bot will be modified to interface with this data
-Do stuff with data like I did with FNF in skulltag! (How exactly did I do that...? Â Can't remember...)
	-possible stuff to do with .cfg data:
		1.) calculate the # of events per gamemode, helps balance out randomization
		2.) calculate mods played and its corresponding numbers
		3.) look at the date of event (if there happens to be an event # with it) and see what has been neglected the most recently
		4.) ???
